This is the repository of the game "Slide" which I developed for about a year,
but in the end I abandoned it because I did not calculate my strength and time for modeling a bunch of objects.
The game was developed between 2014-2015, then I did not have time to transfer to the new Unity UI
and was also more experienced than that, so wait for a pretty crooked code.
However, if you are still interested, you can watch it :-)
